# AIDF Task Templates

Structured templates for AI-assisted development tasks. Each task type has a specific template with goal, scope, requirements, and definition of done.

## Available Task Types

### Component
New feature or component implementation. Includes scope definition, implementation requirements, and quality gates.

### Refactor
Code restructuring without changing behavior. Requires before/after comparison and all existing tests must pass.

### Test
Adding or improving test coverage. Defines coverage targets, test categories, and quality thresholds.

### Docs
Documentation writing or improvement. Accuracy verification, working examples, and audience targeting.

### Architecture
System design and planning. Trade-off analysis, component diagrams, and migration paths.

### Bugfix
Bug reproduction and fix. Requires root cause analysis, fix verification, and regression test.
